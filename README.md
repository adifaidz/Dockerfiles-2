# Dockerfiles
These are Dockerfiles I've created for programs without official docker image or with bad one. I'll be grateful for any contribution or improvement.

All images are up-to-date and automaticly builded on [My Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ondrejmo)  

**README.md** file is in root directory of each image and contains link to the github repo of that program and the function wrapper I use. Can be easily extracted using getreadme function or source in this repo.
